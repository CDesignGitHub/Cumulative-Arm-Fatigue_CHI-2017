# Cumulative Arm Fatigue and Biomechanical Arm Analysis
This project includes the impementation of cumulative fatigue model and biomechanical arm analysis. 
This project consists of C/C++ headers, source codes, and closed-source library to compute shourlder torques and cumulative arm fatigue (three-compartment muscle states).
We provide an example project where an upper body joint tracking data ("KinectSkeletonData.dat") is loaded to compute shoulder joint torque and three-compartment muscle states.
The results are stored in a data file ("result.dat") and can be further displayed using MATLAB scripts (see folder "Matlab code").
This project is still under development and will be progressively updated.
Please send any question or request to Sujin Jang (steve.sujin.jang[at]gmail.com) or Ana Villanueva (villana[at]purdue.edu).

# Development Environment
1. Compiler: MS Visual Studio 2013/2015 (C/C++)
2. OS: MS Windows 8
3. (Optional) Matlab for plotting results
